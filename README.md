The 'bulk_search' ingredient is designed to extend EPrints 3.4 by adding the ability to search for an arbitrary set of eprints via their IDs.
This then returns a normal search result which can then in turn be used to batch edit, add to a list, export etc.
Bulk search is presented as an Admin - Editorial Tool.

This should arguably just be added to EPrints Core.
